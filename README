Modify tiapp.xml and manifest file as per Appcelerator Doc
You need to download and setup ti.map and ti.imagefactory from the market.
Setup ti.map for Google Map V2 according to the doc
This app is using 2 web services --- One reads Streetlights location from the database --- You cannot call this webservice.
You can remove my code that is used for this. This is not required.
The other one POST to SF 311 API and reads a response from XML that is returned.
You would need your OWN API KEY to submit 311 Request. You also cannot call this webservice but you can use Titanium Network Services
to POST and read and parse respnose.
Any questions or comments are Welcome.
